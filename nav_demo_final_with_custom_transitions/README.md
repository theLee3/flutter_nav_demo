# nav_demo_final_with_custom_transitions

This is a minimal working example of Flutter's updated (declarative) navigation and routing mechanism. This example demonstrates how we can leverage the `Router`, `Page`, and `RouterInformationParser` classes to create an app that behaves as expected across mobile, desktop, and web. A `CustomTransitionBuilder` class defines the animations used during page transitions.
